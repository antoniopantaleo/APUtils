/// If the current thread is already the main thread, it immediately executes the `executionBlock`.

/// - Parameter executionBlock: The block of code to be executed on the main thread
///
/// - Warning: Be careful when calling this function from the main thread with a block that could
/// potentially block the thread (like waiting for a network response), as it could lead to a deadlock.
